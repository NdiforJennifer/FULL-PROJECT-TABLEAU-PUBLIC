# FULL-PROJECT-TABLEAU-PUBLIC

This is a project on creating dashboards on Tableau


About Dataset ( Source Kaggle)



Context


Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique, personalized way. As part of the Airbnb Inside initiative, this dataset describes the listing activity of homestays in Seattle, WA.

Content


The following Airbnb activity is included in this Seattle dataset:

Listings, including full descriptions and average review score
Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day
Inspiration
Can you describe the vibe of each Seattle neighborhood using listing descriptions?
What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle? By how much do prices spike?
Is there a general upward trend of both new Airbnb listings and total Airbnb visitors to Seattle?

TASK
I created a UNION and joined the Listing and Calendar spreadsheets data sets using a full inner join based on the ID. 

First, I developed several dashboards to calculate the following metrics:
- Price per Zip Code
- Zip Code per Location
- Revenue per Year
- Average Price per Bedroom
- Distinct Count of Listing Bedrooms

In the final sheet, I grouped all the dashboards and arranged them in a visually appealing manner for users. The project can be downloaded from Tableau Public using the link below.
